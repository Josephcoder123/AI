        "*   The **total estimated annual operational cost** was calculated at \\$315,000.00. Significant cost drivers included labor (\\$120,000.00) and feedstock acquisition/transportation (\\$80,000.00).\n",
        "*   The **total estimated annual revenue** from the sale of dried BSF larvae, BSF frass, and BSF oil was \\$105,000.00. Dried BSF larvae contributed \\$75,000.00, BSF frass \\$15,000.00, and BSF oil \\$15,000.00.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   **Re-evaluate and Optimize Cost Structures & Revenue Potential**: Given the significant unprofitability, it is crucial to thoroughly re-examine all cost assumptions for potential reductions (e.g., lower-cost feedstock sourcing, energy efficiency, labor optimization) and simultaneously investigate higher-value revenue streams or increased production volumes, possibly exploring premium markets or additional products like chitin.\n",
        "*   **Conduct In-depth Market Research and Scale Optimization**: Undertake more detailed market research to validate product pricing and demand for BSF products in Kenya and East Africa, and perform a techno-economic assessment to identify an optimal facility scale and technology that could achieve better cost efficiency and profitability. This should also include exploring potential government incentives or subsidies for sustainable agriculture.\n"
